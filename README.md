I was born into a low-income family in Brazil. 
We were poor — sometimes we didn't even have enough food. 
I fell in love with computers at a very young age and would sneak onto my uncle's computer 
at night to teach myself how to code while still in middle school. 
I attended public schools, but I studied every single day to earn a place in the engineering program 
at the best university in my country.

My dad was murdered, and I never found out what really happened. 
I poured myself into my studies and earned a full scholarship for a PhD in String Theory and Astrophysics in New York. 
In the beginning, my spoken English was rough, but I enrolled in more classes than I needed and studied every moment I could. 
I wrote books, contributed to open-source projects, and fell in love with software engineering all over again.

By the end of my PhD, I turned down a postdoc offer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for a job as a Software Engineer at Yelp. 
In less than a year, I was poached by Apple. After working as an engineer for a while, I realized I wanted to start 
my own company — something my dad had always dreamed of but could never pursue due to the difficult economic situation 
in Brazil.

I tried several approaches, but it's incredibly hard to build anything without real leverage — and without crossing moral lines. 
So I decided to join Shopify to learn more. Then DeFi Summer happened, and I got hooked on crypto again. 
I left my safe and well-paid job to go all in, building in crypto, with countless ideas for new products and research. 
I dreamed of a decentralized, logical, and fair future — something I had been passionate about [for decades](https://acervodigital.ufpr.br/handle/1884/24232). 
Since then, I've tried many things, faced many failures, and celebrated many successes. 
I'm still walking this *rocky* road less traveled.

It's really hard to be a woman in my world — it was hard decades ago, and it's still hard now. 
It's even harder to be an autistic Latina. Harder still to be on your own. 
But I will never allow anyone to call me a victim. I am healthy, smart, young, and capable of building <a href="https://gist.github.com/von-steinkirch/7607c9a481a49dadfd1dcdd9acad15c5">any reality I dream of</a>. 
My real superpower is that I never give up. And that's something <a href="https://www.loyal.love/chapters/25_spring.html#2025_april_27">no monsters</a> can take from me.

ps: plus... I'm completely in love with someone pretty p⽊rfect — and there's nothing I want more in this life than to marry him, have the smartest kids with him, and love and honor him until the end of my days (all while helping build <a href="https://gist.github.com/von-steinkirch/30b106b17b89110e345325af2c444f9f">a better future for humanity</a>).
