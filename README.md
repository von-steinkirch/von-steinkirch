### 👋🏼 hello there, anon

<br>

#### i am a [theoretical physicist by training (b.sc., m.sc. *en route*, ph.d.)](https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/) and a [principal software engineer by trade](https://marina.vonsteinkirch.com/). i started [coding in middle school](https://web.archive.org/web/20070322015644/http://fly.to/bytegirl) and now have over two decades of experience, working at large companies, startups, and private projects — both as an individual contributor and in leadership roles. 

#### in addition, i am also a [writer, philosopher, and filmmaker](https://13.vonsteinkirch.com/). i'm very grateful for G'd for the legacy i've been building over the years and for the opportunity to have spent the first part of my life fully dedicated to my career && studies. 

#### now, i've started a new phase of my life, one where i leverage all my knowledge && experience [to continue building my legacy](https://gist.github.com/von-steinkirch/7b0a78df77d7d15f263b99be1713d996) through the lens of wisdom && maturity (while also focusing on my partner, home, and family). 

#### ps: please beware of scammers, impersonators, deepfakes, or anyone claiming they "date" me and/or distributing hacked material from my private life, etc. i will never reach out first or ask for anything. i've been off social media for many years and [the only official links for my work are the ones in my website](https://vonsteinkirch.com/).
